vehicle_demo.txt

*Purpose*
vehicle_demo is a simple Ruby application that demonstrates both inheritance and the use of mix-ins to concisely implement a set of related classes representing different types of vehicles.

*Problem Statement*
Create a repo that contains these classes:
 ·  Car
 ·  Motorcycle
 ·  Vehicle
 ·  Tank
 ·  Helicopter
 ·  QuadCopter
 ·  Plane
 ·  Person
 ·  ElectricCar
 ·  ElectricMotorcycle
 ·  ElectricTank
 Add additional classes or modules as necessary.
 Where appropriate, each class should have a combination of class and
 instance methods:
 ·  wheelnum
 ·  max_passengers
 ·  electric?
 ·  age
 ·  manufacturer
 ·  model_num
 ·  weapons?
 If weapons? returns true, it should also implement:
 ·  shoot!
 ·  reload!
 ·  remaining_ammo
 ·  max_ammo

*Design Decisions*
 ·  _Allow a person to be mobile and have weapons_ -- While in other contexts, a Person may be totally unrelated to a vehicle, a person can actually move, carry at least a small passenger, and bear arms. Therefore, an ArmedMobilePerson class is implemented that represents a person with these potential capabilities. While other required classes inherit from Vehicle, ArmedMobilePerson obtains its weapon and mobile capabilities through the use of mixins.
 ·  _All objects respond to electric? & weapons?_ without producing an unknown method exception. The best way to do this is to "monkey-patch" the Object class to implement these methods. In order to generalize this feature, the specific methods are renamed is_electric? and has_weapons?. A method_missing method is added to Object that returns false for any method of the form /is\w+\?/ or /has\w+\?/, and invokes super otherwise. In that manner, these format method invocations return false unless specifically implemented by class or module definitions.
